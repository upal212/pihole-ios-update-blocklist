# Pihole iOS Update Blocklist
<p>Ok, what is it? It's a list of domains/hosts which is involved in updating your iOS devices. Personally, I like staying in the firmware that I like and this list gives everyone the freedom of updating iOS at our own will.</p>
<p>It's a lightweight list.</p>

### How to use?
  Just add the following list to your pi-hole.
